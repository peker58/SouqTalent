## Getting Started

This is the instructions on setting up this project locally.
To run the project locally follow these simple example steps.

### Description

This is the main backend with MongoDb database providing a robust and reliable database to store and manage user data. One of the key features of our MongoDB backend is its user authentication, authorization system and authenticate routes, which allows users to securely log in and access the app's functionality. Using the popular JSON Web Token (JWT) standard, our backend generates and verifies user tokens, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data. In addition to authorization functionality, our MongoDB backend provides a range of other features to support our MERN project like APIs CRUD operations, Data validation, Error handling, Scalability in distributing backend architecture and automatic sharding capabilities that can handle even the largest and most complex datasets.

### Build

To build the package, run the following command:

```
pnpm run build
```

### Develop

To run the development server, run the following command:

```
pnpm run dev
```

## Usage

This is an example of how you can use the backend package in your project.
Once you have installed the project, you can import the package and use it in your app directory.

```jsx
import apiConnector from '@metajob/api-connector'

// find all jobs
const connect = await apiConnector
const jobs = await connect.getJobs()

```

In the above example, you can see that all the backend functions are in the connect object. You can pass the required props to the function and use it in your project.
